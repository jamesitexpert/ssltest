# ToDo: Renegotiation checks, certificate checks.  May or may not decide to do this....
# PCI - no MD5 certs, no SGC certs, organisation (not domain) cert validation, revocation checking for each cert in chain, no insecure renegotiation, >1024 bit RSA/DSA keys in certs
# ISM - no insecure renegotiation, preference for SHA-2 certs, no MD5 certs


# History:
# Changes 0.1 - 0.1.1 : Minor bug fix and cosmetic changes
# Changes 0.1.1 - 0.1.2: More minor cosmetic changes, 
# Changes 0.1.2 - 0.2: More cosmetic changes, Windows Support, improved greppable output, Help text re OpenSSL, helpful errors for missing modules
# Changes 0.2 - 0.3: Added check to confirm listening service on host:port before running SSL tests, and added checks for friendly https cipher denials
# Changes 0.3 - 0.4: Minor bugfix with list command, all SSL2 ciphers now not listed as supported under pci
# Changes 0.4 - 0.5: Updated PCI and ISM supported ciphers, added TLVv1.1 and TLSv1.2 support, refreshed cipher list, disabled default certificate verification, updated help, added optional ISM checks

sub friendlyerror {
	print STDERR <<FRIENDLYHELPTEXT;

One or more friendly SSL error messages were detected during the cipher 
testing process.  These will allow an SSL connection only for the purpose 
of providing a friendly error message to the client to update their browser
to a newer version.  The process used by this tool to detect these errors is
a little simplistic and potentially prone to errors, so if you see this
message I suggest you run the test with the triple verbose mode (-vvv) 
enabled to see the HTTP response from the server that has triggered this 
detection.  If you think that the detection is a false negative you can 
disable the check using the -f switch, and you can also inform the author of
this tool about the issue so this feature can be improved.

If you like the friendly option, and don't want to see this error message any 
more you can also prevent it from displaying in future by using the -n 
option.

See the help for more information.

It appears your Perl install does not include the IO::Socket::SSL module, 
which is required for this tool to work.

If you are running ActivePerl on Windows, this module, as well as the
dependant Net::SSLeay do not exist in the ActiveState Repositories, so 
you will need to go to a third party repository appropriate for your 
particular version of Perl.  The uwinnipeg repository is a good source,
just add it from the suggested list in the PPM Preferences window, or 
visit the following URL as a jumping off point to find the correct
repository for your version of perl (the below link is for perl 5.10
but there are links there for perl versions 5.6, 5.8 and 5.12):

http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/PPMPackages/10xx/

Don't forget to install "IO-Socket-SSL" AND "Net-SSLeay", and while you're 
there you may as well also install "Win32-Console-ANSI" to get coloured
terminal output (although it is possible to do without this if you use
greppable output).

If running perl on Linux, you can install the needed modules from CPAN.

In both cases you will also require OpenSSL on your system, and the version
of OpenSSL you use may effect your ability to connect to particular systems.
I have had good results with OpenSSL versions 0.9.8g and below but your 
mileage may vary.  Binary versions of OpenSSL for Windows can be obtained
from here, version 0.9.8e is suggested:

http://code.google.com/p/openssl-for-windows/ 

Stick the ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll files in your path.

For Linux just use your distributions package management system or grab and 
install OpenSSL from source.

ssltest $version
Stephen Bradshaw, www.thegreycorner.com

Tests the provided SSL host to determine supported SSL/TLS protocols and
ciphers.  


USAGE:

$0 [options] host port
$0 [--pci|--ssl2|--ssl3|--tls1|--tls11|--tls12] --list


OPTIONS:

  -v|--verbose  Verbosity level. Use once to also list tested 
                ciphers that are not enabled on the target host.
                Use twice to also show when host connection 
                attempts are made.  Use three times to also show
                the output of HTTP responses from the server
                (used to detect friendly SSL messages - see the
                help for the -f switch below for more info). Its
                a good idea to turn on verbosity if you are
                getting unexpected results at any time.

  -r|--ssl2     Performs cipher tests for the sslv2 protocol.
                Default is all protocols (ssl2, ssl3, tls1, 
                tls11, tls12).

  -s|--ssl3     Performs cipher tests for the sslv3 protocol.
                Default is all protocols (ssl2, ssl3, tls1, 
                tls11, tls12).
                
  -t|--tls1     Performs cipher tests for the tlsv1 protocol.
                Default is all protocols (ssl2, ssl3, tls1, 
                tls11, tls12).
                
  -b|--tls11    Performs cipher tests for the tlsv1.1 protocol.
                Default is all protocols (ssl2, ssl3, tls1, 
                tls11, tls12).
                
  -c|--tls12    Performs cipher tests for the tlsv1.2 protocol.
                Default is all protocols (ssl2, ssl3, tls1, 
                tls11, tls12).

  -x|--timeout	Sets timeout value in seconds for connections.  
                Default 4.  Lower value for hosts that may not 
                properly close connections when an unsupported 
                protocol request is attempted.  Raise value for 
                slow links/hosts.

  -i|--ism      Marks enabled ciphers that are compliant with the 
                DSD ISMs mandatory 'Must' standards for use as an
                AACP (ISM 2014).  Default compliance standard used
                (as opposed to PCI).

  -p|--pci      Marks enabled ciphers that are compliant with 
                PCI-DSS standards.  Provided as an alternate 
                compliance standard to the DSD ISM.

  -g|--grep     Outputs in a semicolon ";" separated greppable 
                format, adds text for compliance status.  Use 
                when you need to write output to a text file and 
                you want compliance status to be included in 
                text format instead of just being represented by 
                terminal colour.  Fields ouput are Status;
                Hostname:Port;SSL-Protocol;Cipher-Name;
                Cipher-Description.  Compliance status will be one
                of C (Compliant), N (Non-compliant) or D (Disabled
                - only in verbose mode).

  -l|--list     Lists ciphers checked by this tool and exits, 
                with output colour coded to indicate compliance 
                status with the selected standard (pci or ism).  
                Host and port values do not need to be provided 
                when using this option, as no host connection is 
                made.  Purely informational, so you can see what
                ciphers are tested for, and which are deemed to be
                compliant with the various standards.

  -f|--friend   Disables checks for "friendly" SSL errors. 
                These checks are enabled by default, and will
                essentially try and detect any sites that allow an 
                SSL connection just so that they can tell you to
                get a newer browser.  At the moment this test is
                done very crudely by checking for a HTTP 1.1 401
                Unauthorised message in response to a GET request.
                This is quite possibly prone to false negatives, so
                the tool will warn you if such a detection has 
                occurred and will suggest that you run the test
                again in triple verbose mode to see the HTTP response
                from the server.  If the response does not appear
                to suggest that SSL is only supported for the 
                purpose of a warning the user to upgrade their 
                browser, you can run the test again with this
                switch to disable the friendly check.
                
  -n|--nohelp   Disables the display of helpful (but potentially 
                unwanted) messages, such as the warning about the 
                friendly SSL detection.
                
  -z|--vercert  Enables verification of certificates.  Otherwise,
                peer certificate verification is disabled.


If one or more protocol/s (SSLV2, SSLV3, TLSV1, TLSv11, TLSv12) are not 
specifically enabled, tests for all protocols will be performed.  If you 
know that a host does not support certain protocols (or does not properly 
close connection attempts made using particular protocols) you can only 
include tests for the protocols you are interested in to speed up the test.
If no compliance standard is specifically enabled, or if more than one 
is selected the default is to use the DSD ISM.

This tool is dependant on using OpenSSL to make SSL connections, and since 
OpenSSL sometimes changes the format of SSL requests in different versions
of the software, if you are having problems getting a connection to a
particular host you may be able to resolve them by using a later (or
earlier) version of OpenSSL.  On Windows you will be using the OpenSSL dll 
files, which are named ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll and are probably in 
your path.  Check the version of these dll files to determine the OpenSSL 
version.  The binary versions of the dll files that the author uses with 
this tool can be obtained from:
http://code.google.com/p/openssl-for-windows/.

On Linux you will be using libssl, and you can check the version using your
systems package management software.

Some newer versions of OpenSSL and Net::SSLeay disable support for SSLv2 
which is needed to perform the SSLv2 checks - the checks will return false 
negatives if this is the case.  See the following for information on how 
to resolve this on Ubuntu, modifying as needed if you have a newer Ubuntu
version than 13.04

http://www.techstacks.com/howto/enable-sslv2-and-tlsv12-in-openssl-101c-on-ubuntu-1304.html
http://www.techstacks.com/howto/enable-sslv2-methods-in-netssleay.html

If on 64 bit architecture, you may also need to modify your deb files to 
change dependancies for libc6-amd64 to libc6 before installing.  Extract
the deb files, modify the DEBIAN/control file and rebuild the deb using 
'dpkg-deb --build <folder_name>'


EXAMPLES:

$0 -vvrsi test.example.com 443

Performs testing on host test.example.com port 443, using the sslv3 protocol
(-s), and sslv2 protocol (-r), matches responses against the cipher 
requirements in the ISM (-i) and provides double verbose output (-vv) where 
ciphers unsupported by the destination host and connection attempts are printed
to screen.

$0 --list 

Provides a list of all ciphers supported by the tool, colour coded to indicate 
which ones are considered to be compliant with the ISM.  Add the --pci switch 
to colour code listed ciphers for PCI compliance instead, or supply the --ssl2,
--ssl3 or --tls1 switches to only list ciphers appropriate to those protocols.
